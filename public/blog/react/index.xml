      <description>&lt;p&gt;Recently, the company I work for switched their frontend web framework from Vue.js to React.js. I think it’s fair to say that React has a harder learning curve 📈 than Vue.js. Vue is also arguably smarter when it comes to change detection and re-rendering as you don’t have to worry about passing in dependencies to computed/watched/side effects. With React ⚛️ on the other hand, it’s a lot easier to shoot yourself in the foot if you overlook the nuances of the framework. One of the distinct features in React.js are hooks.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
