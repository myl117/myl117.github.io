      <description>&lt;p&gt;Previously, we built a fantasy ledger application in Java Spring Boot, whipped up a frontend and hooked it up to an in-memory SQL database all while sticking to the principles of MVC.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&amp;rsquo;s great and all, but the only way to actually interact with our app is by running it locally, which can be a bit of a hassle 🤦 to set up every time. We want our creation to be accessible from every corner of the realm 🌎, not just a single device. Today, we&amp;rsquo;re going to fix that by dockerising our application and launching it on a cloud platform called &lt;a href=&#34;http://fly.io&#34;&gt;Fly.io&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I’ve been wanting to put together a beginner-friendly Java Spring Boot tutorial that takes you through everything starting from installing Java, to understanding the core principles of databases, CRUD operations and MVC while keeping it fun. But I didn’t want to fall into the trap of making yet another todo app.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since I’m a huge fan of fantasy media 🧝‍♂️ and books like A Song of Ice and Fire and The Lord of the Rings, I decided to build a fantasy-themed ledger web app. In it, users can create mini log entries that persist through a backend database. The fantasy theme also gives us room to get creative with CSS and styling!&lt;/p&gt;</description>
