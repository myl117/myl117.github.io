      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;rsquo;re new to learning a low level programming language like C and have, like myself, come from the world of high level programming, building something as simple as an HTTP server can be quite daunting. But despite the perceived complexity, it is an awesome way to get more acquainted with the C syntax and essential skills like memory management, pointers and understanding core TCP/IP concepts.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h2 id=&#34;what-is-a-tcp-socket&#34;&gt;What is a TCP Socket?&lt;/h2&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;TCP sockets are simply endpoints for communication between two machines over a network, using the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). In practical terms, a socket is a combination of an IP address (we&amp;rsquo;ll be sticking to IPV4), a protocol (TCP) and a port number. A socket acts like a two-way pipe. For two applications to communicate, they must both create a socket on their machines and then connect to each other to establish a communication channel.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
